# OAuth2 Proxy K8s Operator

This is the Kubernetes Python Operator for the
[OAuth2 Proxy](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/).

## Description

OAuth2 Proxy is a reverse proxy and static file server that authenticates users
through providers like Google and GitHub, allowing validation by email, domain,
or group.

This operator provides the OAuth2 proxy, and consists of Python scripts which
wraps the versions distributed by
[OAuth2 Proxy](https://quay.io/repository/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy?tab=tags&tag=latest).

## Usage

The OAuth2 Proxy charm can be used to enable authentication for charmed applications
by integrating it with [Identity Platform](https://charmhub.io/identity-platform).

To deploy Charmed OAuth2 Proxy, you need to run the following command:

```shell
juju deploy oauth2-proxy-k8s --channel edge --trust
```

You can follow the deployment status with `watch -c juju status --color`.

## Integrations

### Ingress

The Charmed OAuth2 Proxy offers integration with the [traefik-k8s-operator](https://github.com/canonical/traefik-k8s-operator) for ingress.

In order to provide ingress to the application, run:

```shell
juju deploy traefik-k8s traefik-public --channel latest/stable --trust
juju integrate traefik-public oauth2-proxy-k8s:ingress
```

### Traefik ForwardAuth

OAuth2 Proxy offers integration with
Traefik [ForwardAuth](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/forwardauth/)
middleware via `forward_auth` interface.

It can be added by deploying
the [Traefik charmed operator](https://charmhub.io/traefik-k8s), enabling the
experimental feature and adding a juju integration:

```shell
juju config traefik-public enable_experimental_forward_auth=True
juju integrate oauth2-proxy-k8s traefik-public:experimental-forward-auth
```

### Auth Proxy

OAuth2 Proxy can be integrated with downstream charmed operators
using `auth_proxy` interface.

To have your charm protected by the proxy, make sure that:

- it is integrated with Traefik using one of the [ingress interfaces](https://github.com/canonical/traefik-k8s-operator/tree/main/lib/charms/traefik_k8s)
- it provides OAuth2 Proxy with necessary data by supporting
  the [integration](https://github.com/canonical/oauth2-proxy-k8s-operator/blob/main/lib/charms/oauth2_proxy_k8s/v0/auth_proxy.py).

Then complete setting up the proxy:

```shell
juju integrate your-charm traefik-public
juju integrate oauth2-proxy-k8s your-charm:auth-proxy
```

### Identity Platform

Identity Platform is a composable identity provider and identity broker system based on Juju.

It comes with a built-in identity and user management system, but is also able to rely on external identity providers
to authenticate users and manage user attributes. Find out more about integrating it with providers like Google, Microsoft Entra ID
or GitHub [here](https://charmhub.io/identity-platform/docs/how-to/integrate-external-identity-provider).

Refer to [this](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-identity-platform/tutorials/e2e-tutorial) tutorial to learn how to deploy and configure the Identity Platform.

Charmed OAuth2 Proxy connects with the Identity Platform with the use of Hydra charmed
operator. To integrate it, run:

```shell
juju integrate oauth2-proxy-k8s:oauth hydra
```

Note that `oauth` requires `ingress` integration provided by Traefik Charmed Operator.
